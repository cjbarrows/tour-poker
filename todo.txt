TODO:
- save and load game state
- finish bidding
- discard/redraw cards
- calculate winner
- admin screen to "load stage"
- seems like checking localStorage.getItem() in PrivateRoute isn't secure at all
  - meaning: I can fake being "Katie" and see her cards (unless we restrict reading to only data they have access to)
- pass the authentication token to the backend
- don't socket.io connect until logged in

DONE:
- somehow I ended up with two Rick Zabel's in my hand, one in kom and one in points (!)
- admin screen for viewing
- admin screen for saving? (or use Firestore admin?) [yes]
