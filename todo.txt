[ ] use the same "dealer" for the whole stage/game
	- phases advance after reaching the dealer
[ ] 5 card draw: phases: [shuffle; deal(D, D, D, D, D); bid; draw; bid; showdown]
[ ] 7 card stud: phases: [shuffle, deal(D, D, U), bid, deal(U), bid, deal(U), bid, deal(U), bid, deal(D), bid, showdown]
[ ] texas: phases: [shuffle, deal(DD), bid, deal(S, S, S), bid, deal(S), bid, deal(S), bid, showdown]
[ ] endTurn:
	deal 1, [DDU] [phase, dealPattern]


TODO:
- test folding
- poker hand rankings overlay/cheatsheet
- in "deal" phase, show players cards so they can view/click on them
- allow different dealing patterns (ie, 7-card-stud, texas hold em, etc.)
- seems like checking localStorage.getItem() in PrivateRoute isn't secure at all
  - meaning: I can fake being "Katie" and see her cards (unless we restrict reading to only data they have access to)
- pass the authentication token to the backend
- don't socket.io connect until logged in

DONE:
- somehow I ended up with two Rick Zabel's in my hand, one in kom and one in points (!)
- admin screen for viewing
- admin screen for saving? (or use Firestore admin?) [yes]
- save game state
- load game state
- use stage results as a first priority
- if there are insufficient stage results, use gc
- make deck from stage admin button
- show results of makedeck (ie, # of cards of each suit?)
- add 'deal' phase, one card at a time
- save player state (including hands) and deck state [saved with deck]
  - save "owner" (and "hand position") to cards (including "discard" as owner)
- load player money & stake [by year]
- save player money -- what else? stake?
- reveal name of poker hand
- way to easily set active year/stage (ie, game)
- "restart game" admin function?
- or even a "start game" function to populate bid, gamePhases, phase, pot, stage, turn, year, dealer, etc!
- where are the "dealer" and first "turn" players set? [admin page]
- or is that my "admin" page?
- discard/redraw cards
- finish bidding
- calculate winner
