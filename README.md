This is a card game (poker) I made to play with my family while we were on vacation. It uses the results of that day's Tour de France to set the ranks of the cards (riders who score higher get the "better" cards). It was a fun way to get the whole family excited about the Tour de France. And when my game proudly announced, "Katie has won with Nothing," it showed everyone the sneaky comic power of software bugs.
